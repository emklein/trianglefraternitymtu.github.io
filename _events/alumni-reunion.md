# Reunion

With a larger number of involved alumni and with the aim of getting back in touch with those who have drifted away, the need was identified for a large event to bring people together. The Alumni Reunion is typically held every 5 years. The most recent anticipated reunion was supposed to have been in 2020, however, due to the risks of COVID-19 it was postponed. We will reschedule as soon as COVID-19 no longer poses a signficant health and safety risk.

# Details
Thanks for checking in! We hope to see you at the next event!

Make sure to update your Alumni information on the [update form](http://infoupdate.mtutriangle.org/) so you receive information about the reunion as well as present day Active and Alumni activities.
